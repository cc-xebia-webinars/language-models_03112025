# Efficient model inference
# =========================

Efficient model inference is the process of running a trained model in a way that minimizes computational resources—such as time, memory, and power consumption—while still delivering accurate results. This is crucial when deploying models in production, especially on devices with limited hardware capabilities (like mobile phones or edge devices) or in environments where low latency is essential.

To achieve this, techniques like quantization (reducing the numerical precision of weights), pruning (removing less important parameters), and other optimizations are applied. For instance, using quantization methods like q8_0 or q4_k_m reduces the model's size and speeds up computations by converting full-precision numbers into lower-bit representations, which leads to faster and more resource-efficient inference without a substantial loss in performance.
