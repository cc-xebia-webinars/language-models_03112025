# PEFT library

The PEFT library stands for **Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning**. It provides techniques that allow you to fine-tune large pre-trained models by modifying only a small subset of their parameters instead of updating all of them. This approach offers several benefits:

- **Resource Efficiency:** By updating fewer parameters, you can reduce both the memory footprint and computational costs, which is particularly valuable when working with very large models.
- **Speed:** Fine-tuning becomes faster since you're not recalculating gradients for the entire model.
- **Flexibility:** PEFT methods (like LoRA, adapters, or prefix-tuning) enable you to adapt models to new tasks with minimal changes, often without losing the benefits of the original pre-trained model.

In essence, the PEFT library is a practical solution for adapting powerful language models to specific tasks in a resource-friendly and efficient way.
