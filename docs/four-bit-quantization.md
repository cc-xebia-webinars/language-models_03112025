# 4-Bit Quantization

4-bit quantization compresses model parameters so that each parameter uses only 4 bits instead of the typical 16 or 32 bits. This offers several benefits:

- **Reduced Memory Footprint:**  
  The model requires significantly less memory, making it possible to run large models on devices with limited GPU memory.

- **Faster Inference:**  
  With lower memory usage, data transfer and memory bandwidth demands are reduced. This can speed up inference, especially when the hardware and libraries (e.g., bitsandbytes) are optimized for low-precision operations.

- **Potential Energy Efficiency:**  
  Using lower precision can also reduce energy consumption, which is valuable in resource-constrained environments.

However, there are some trade-offs:

- **Slight Accuracy Loss:**  
  Lower precision may lead to minor drops in accuracy or precision, though modern quantization techniques are designed to minimize this impact.

- **Hardware and Software Dependencies:**  
  The performance improvements are often dependent on having the right hardware support and optimized libraries for 4-bit operations.

Overall, 4-bit quantization is a trade-off that prioritizes reduced memory usage and increased throughput, with only a marginal impact on model accuracy for many applications.
