# LMs on Titanic Dataset

Using a finetuned language model for the Titanic dataset can seem unconventional since the dataset is a classic example of structured (tabular) data. However, there are several reasons why one might choose this approach over traditional machine learning methods:

## 1. Unified Modeling Approach

- **Multi-Modal Flexibility:** If your overall system already incorporates a language model for other tasks (such as generating reports, explanations, or handling unstructured text), extending its use to structured data can simplify the architecture by using one model for multiple data types.
- **Integration Ease:** A single, unified model can handle both text and tabular data, reducing the need for separate pipelines.

## 2. Reduced Feature Engineering

- **Implicit Feature Extraction:** Traditional models often require extensive feature engineering—manually converting categorical variables, scaling numeric data, and so on. A finetuned language model can learn representations from data formatted as text, potentially reducing or bypassing some of the manual preprocessing.
- **End-to-End Learning:** By converting the tabular data into a text-based format, the model might automatically capture interactions and patterns without explicit feature design.

## 3. Transfer Learning and Pre-Training Advantages

- **Leverage Vast Pre-Training:** Language models are typically pre-trained on large corpora of text. This pre-training can provide a form of transfer learning, where the model's understanding of language and context may help it generalize better even with a smaller dataset like Titanic.
- **Robustness:** In some cases, the external knowledge encoded during pre-training can assist in capturing subtler relationships within the data that traditional models might miss without significant feature engineering.

## 4. Enhanced Interpretability and Flexibility

- **Natural Language Explanations:** A language model can be prompted to provide natural language explanations for its predictions. This added layer of interpretability can be valuable for communicating results to non-technical stakeholders.
- **Interactive Reasoning:** The model’s ability to reason in a conversational manner might allow for interactive querying and explanations, potentially uncovering insights into the decision-making process.

## 5. Experimental and Research Motivation

- **Exploration of Novel Approaches:** Employing a language model on a tabular task like the Titanic dataset can be an interesting research experiment to test the limits and adaptability of these models.
- **Benchmarking Alternative Methods:** Comparing a finetuned language model with traditional machine learning methods might provide insights into when and why one approach might outperform the other under certain conditions.

## Conclusion

While traditional machine learning models—such as logistic regression, decision trees, or random forests—are typically more straightforward and computationally efficient for structured datasets like Titanic, a finetuned language model offers unique benefits. These include reduced reliance on manual feature engineering, the potential for transfer learning benefits, and enhanced natural language interpretability. Ultimately, the choice depends on your specific project goals, the complexity you’re willing to manage, and whether the additional capabilities of a language model align with your application’s needs.
